          <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
          <p><em><b>HTML</b></em> is a markup language that defines the structure of the content on a webpage. Sections of markup are defined with <em><b>Elements</b></em>, which are used to carve out sections of the structure. HTML <em><b>Tags</b></em> are used to define those elements, and Internet browsers read and display HTML content to the user. Tags have an opening and closing component, with a few exceptions. Moreover, we can add <em><b>Attributes</b></em> to a tag to specify how the content will display (explained later with CSS).<sup><a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/what-is-html/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup> Although this section provides only basic principles required of an HTML template, you can vist them good folks over at <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Mozilla</a> to learn everything there is to know about web design and development. Better yet, check out the free HTML and CSS tutorial <a class="link" href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a> put together: its perfect for an absolute beginner to learn the nuances of web design!</p>

          <h4>Required Elements for an HTML Template</h4>
          <p>The required structural elements for an HTML template are as follow:</p>
          <img src="img/requiredHTML.jpg"> 
          <p>The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the first line of a page; it declares that this is an HTML file. The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element (aka 'root') is on the second and final line of a page. This element is a wrapper for everything on the entire page: that which can be seen or not!</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is the area consisting of meta information about a page. Within this area you can use <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to make the page mobile-compatible, document the webpage in the browser and specify resources being used, respectively. Web browsers use this information to coordinate all resources required to make the website function as it was designed; none of this information is visible to the user.</p>
          <p>The final required element is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, which is the area where all content that you want displayed to users is placed.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that the <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> is used to <em><b>Comment</b></em> work; it can used to make a note that the designer can refer to later. Comments are not displayed when the HTML document is rendered by a browser so any content contained within them will be hidden!</p>
        </div>
        <!-- -->
        <hr id="elements">
        <div class="intro">
          <!--<h2 class="title"><i class="material-icons">code</i> Using HTML</h2>-->
          <p>Every HTML document is a hierarchical structure made up of elements and their content. This section of the reference describes all the different types of element that you can use to write an HTML document.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The <code>html</code> element is the outer container for everything that appears in an HTML document. It can only contain two elements as direct descendants, namely the <code>head</code> element and a <code>body</code> element.  It can also contain comments.  Although the <code>html</code> element is the outermost element, it does not contain the DOCTYPE—the doctype must come before the html element.  This element will have a place on every single web page you ever create! </p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The <code>head</code> element is the wrapper for all the head elements that, collectively, instruct the browser where to find style sheets, or define relationships that the document has to others in the web site (link); provide meta information (meta); and include scripts that the document will need to apply later on (script).  The <code>title</code> elementis the only <code>head</code> element that is absolutely required.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The <code>body</code> element wraps around all of the content that will be displayed on screen (or in other media, such as print), such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, and so on. Use <code>body</code> to hold all the document content that you want to be visible to the reader.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The <code>div</code> element is a generic block-level element. It doesn’t convey any meaning about its contents (unlike a <code>p</code> element that signifies a paragraph, or an <code>h1</code> element that would indicate a level 1 or level 2 heading, respectively); as such, it’s easy to customize it to your needs. The <code>div</code> element is currently the most common method for identifying the structural sections of a document and for laying out a web page using CSS. The <code>div</code> element can be used to group almost any elements together —it can contain any inline or block-level elements you choose, so it has no typical content.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <hr>
          <h4>HEAD / LINK Elements</h4>
          <p>The elements listed in this section are all contained within the head element, and either provide extra information about the page, or reference other resources that are required for the page to display or behave correctly.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>Link	Creates links between a document and a stylesheet (CSS); no-limit to usage of #Links.
          <br><code>link href="url" media="media types" rel="relationship" type="content type"</code>
          <br><code>link rel="stylesheet" href="basic.css"/</code>
          <br>*The charset attribute is intended to identify the character set used in the document that’s referenced within the link element. 
          <br>*The href defines the location of the resource.
          <br>*The rel attribute defines the relationship of referenced document to the referencing document, the rev attribute defines the relationship that the referenced document classification.
          <br>*The type is an optional attribute of the <link> element, that is used to identify the MIME type of the linked resource.  Although it’s optional, browsers may not load the resource if its missing or incorrect.
          <br>The <code>a</code> element’s purpose is simple: it wraps around text, or an image, or both, and refers to another web page, or another section on the same web page; the user can click on the contained text or image. The a element has a number of special attributes, which are detailed below, but the one that you’ll use most of the time—if it’s not the only one you’ll use—is the href attribute. This attribute indicates the link’s destination, be that another web page, a section of the same web page, or some other type of document, such as an image, a spreadsheet, or a PDF document.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>Meta	Provides information about the document content.
          <code>meta content="string"  { http-equiv="http response header" | name="string" } /</code>
          The following meta tags are the most relevant in terms of search engine indexing and interpretation:
          <!— instructs search engines not to index this page, but to follow links from the page —>
          <code>meta name="description" content="A brief description of page content to appear in SEO results"</code>
          <!—comma-separated list of keywords that apply to the page —>
          <code>meta name="keywords" content="reference, SitePoint, HTML, XHTML, standards"</code>
          Script	Used to enclose a series of statements in a scripting language (JS) or refer to an stylesheet (CSS) through the ‘src’ attribute, saved in JS.  **Most Valuable for STYLING!**
          <br>*n this example, the src attribute refers to a script file named "complex.js":
<code>script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/complex.js</code>
          <br>*The language attribute tells the browser which scripting language is to be used inside the script block (or in the file referred to by the src attribute, as shown in the example). It may be the name of the scripting language, or a version-specific implementation of the language (see the values below). The appropriate way to identify the contents of the script element is through the type attribute (for example, you might specify the content as "text/javascript"), and use JavaScript object/feature detection techniques within the script rather than assume that all browsers which support a given version of a scripting language support all of the features of that language—no questions asked.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>STYLE	Used to override the styles set in a linked style sheet, like so:
          <br><code>link rel="stylesheet" href="basic.css"</code> 	/*which contains the selector h2 {color:#066;}*/
          <br><code>style type="text/css">h2 {color:#000;}style</code>	/* override color set in main.css for this page only*/
</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>TITLE	used to summarize the content or purpose of the document.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <hr>
          <h4>LIST Elements</h4>
          <p>The <code>ul</code> element, the name for which is an abbreviation of unordered list, is used to group a collection of items together in a list, but in a way that doesn’t suggest an order of precedence or importance. The <code>ul</code> might be used for anything from a simple shopping list to a collection of links.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The <code>li</code> element defines an individual list item and can only appear inside the handful of list-related elements detailed above. Each list item is represented by a bullet (for unordered lists, defined by the <code>ul</code> element) or a number or letter (in the case of ordered lists, defined by the <code>ol</code> element).</p>
          <!-- -->
          <hr>
          <h4>Random = Put in Order</h4>
          <p><B>SYNTAX</B> The elements in a web page are contained in a tree structure in which html is the root element that splits into the head and body elements. An element may contain other nested elements (for example, a <code>p</code> element can contain <code>span</code>, etc.). Where this occurs, the opening and closing tags must be symmetrical. If an opening paragraph tag is followed by the opening em element, the closing tags must appear in the reverse order.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The concept of Accessibility focuses on making your web content easy for a wide range of users to access. This may include people with vision impairments, people with mobility problems, and those with cognitive issues.  </p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>FORMS using Fieldset and Legend Elements to logically group related form controls, and provide a title for the grouping via the Legend Element.  The Label element links a form control to the associated descriptive text in an unambiguous way (useful for non-visual browsers, using screen readers).</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>IMAGES using Alt-attribute provides a text alternative for an important image; applicable with input type.  The Longdesc-attribute provides a link to additional information about the image.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <hr>
          <h4>ATTRIBUTES</h4>
          <p>HTML <code class="reference"><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/attrs.html">Attributes</a></code> add specificty to elements beyond the scope of styles by adding values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior. There are <code class="reference"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes">Dozens of Attributes</a></code> that can be used for different purposes from simple page layout to building forms or media elements. The main attributes that are found on every website include <code>a <b>href="..."</b></code>, <code>img <b>src="..."</b> <b>alt=""</b></code>, <code>html <b>lang="en-US"</b></code>, <code>xxx <b>title="..."</b></code>, <code>xxx <b>class="..."</b></code> and <code>xxx <b>id="..."</b></code>.</p>
          <p>The title attribute may be used on all elements contained in the body of a document, but is not relevant to the majority of elements found inside the head of the document, e.g. base, script and (perhaps not surprisingly) the title elements.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The id-attribute provides a unique identifies for an element within the document creating a hyperlink. This identifier may also be used in CSS, as a hook that can be used for styling purposes, or with JS, to make changes or add behavior to the element referenced by its unique id.  An id-attribute applied to an element must NOT match an id-attribute used elsewhere on the page.  
</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The class-attribute is like an expansion of the id-attribute, but is capable of being assigned to one or more subtypes, which can be used in CSS for styling or JS to make changes and add behavior to elements belonging to a particular subtype.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>*Classes used for <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/hcalendar/">Calendars</a></p>
          <!-- -->
          <p>The title-attribute provides a title for an element as a ‘tooltip’ on visual browsers; useful with <code>a</code>, <code>link</code> and <code>img</code> providing a title for the linked or embedded resource.</p>
          <!-- -->
          <!--<hr>
          <h4>FORM ELEMENTS</h4>
          <p>BUTTON represents a clickable button; You can add inner HTML content (think <code>em</code>, <code></code> or even <code>img</code>), and make use of :after and :before pseudo-element to achieve complex rendering while <code>input</code> only accepts a text value attribute.  </p>
          <p>INPUT used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user. The semantics of an <code>input</code> varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute. DO NOT STYLE</p>
          <p>SELECT represents a control that presents a menu of options. *The options within the menu are represented by <code>option</code> elements, which can be grouped by <code>optgroup</code> elements. Options can be pre-selected for the user.
          <br>*The HTML <code>option</code> element is used to create a control representing an item within a <code>select</code>, an <code>optgroup</code> or a <code>datalist</code> HTML5 element.
          <br>*The HTML <code>optgroup</code> element  creates a grouping of options within a <code>select</code> element. This is useful to create a drop-down menu.</p>
          <p>FORM represents a document section that contains interactive controls to submit information to a web server.</p>
          <p>TEXTAREA represents a multi-line plain-text editing control. Resizing of textareas is enabled by default, but you can explicitly disable it by including the following: <code>textarea {resize: none;}</code> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement.</p> -->

          <h4>Defining Sections</h4>
          <p>Inside of the body is where all the magic happens. It is here that you can outline information that you want displayed based on the type of information being offered. The most important HTML elements that you can use to section information are the Header, Nav, Main, Section, Article, Aside and Footer.<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup></p>
          <img src="img/section.jpg"> 
          <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag, when used, is the first section users encounter and contains meta information related to the website such as a logo, author or navigational aids. The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag can be used within the header or independently to help users navigate a website, providing links within the current document or to other documents. This tag should be reserved for primary navigation sections only, such as global navigation, a table of contents, previous/next links, or other noteworthy groups of navigational links.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the page, before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, you can use the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag to highlight the page author, copyright data or social media links.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags can be a bit confusing because although they are semantically different (the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> is actually a text content element), act nearly the same when used in the same situation. What is important here is to use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag as the main container for a section and use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag for the most important content of the body.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is used to contain content intended to be independently distributabble such as a magazine article or blog post.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is used for content that is indrectly related to the documents main content such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations. When used within an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element, for example, the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag may identify content related to the author of the article.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- -->
        <hr id="defineContent" >
        <div class="intro">
          <h4>Defining Content</h4>
          <p>Content elements are used to organize sections of content and are nested within any section element. There are dozens of elements that can be used to markup your content, but choosing the right element depends wholly on that which you are marking up. Aside from adding identifying sections of content with headings and adding text, you may want to include an list, a form, some sort of multimedia, a script, interactivity or a web component. There are dozens of elements at your disposal, but the only way you will understand them is to study them.<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Element" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.html-5-tutorial.com/all-html-tags.htm" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup></p>
          <img src="img/content.jpg"> 
          <p>In the example above, there are four kinds of tags used, all of which no project goes without.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tags illustrate a <em><b>Heading</b></em> that is used to define the title of any section. There are six heading levels <code>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</code> which decrease in size from 1 to 6.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag represents a paragraph of text. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is an inline-text semantic creates a <em><b>Hyperlink</b></em> to another webpage, file, or location within the same page. This is an inline text semantic which helps define the meaning or purpose of a word, line or text.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags are used in unison to create an <em><b>Unordered List</b></em> of items, which will display as bullet points. You could also use the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag to create an <em><b>Ordered List</b></em>, which will display an ascending counter.</p>
          <p>There are two other elements that are used frequently enough to mention here. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags are valuable in that they give designers the ability to apply targeted styles to a contained set of content.  A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, while <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is an inline-level element commonly used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block-level element.</p>
          <p>Allow me to point out two things about the <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tag: unlike the other tags used, it is self-closing and it requires <code>src="..."</code> and <code>alt="..."</code> attributes. <a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp">Attributes</a> are useful for manipulating the state of a particular element or referencing a source as illustrated.  Although outside of the scope of our focus here, there are two attribute types that you must become familiar with: <code>class="..."</code> and <code>id="..."</code>. Attributes are always declared in HTML, but their functionality is usually declared in CSS and JavaScript. The one caveat is using attributes to make a website accessible and that is covered below.</p>
          <p>These days more and more developers are using <a class="link" href="https://staticsitegenerators.net" target="_blank">Static Site Generators</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.awwwards.com/what-are-frameworks-22-best-responsive-css-frameworks-for-web-design.html" target="_blank">Frameworks</a> to expedite the markup process. I believe that using an open-source model with a minimal learning curve can help you understand how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together. </p>

           <h4>Accessibility</h4>
           <p>In web design, <em><b>Accessibility</b></em> refers to the practice of designing digital content and applications that can be used by people with visual, motor, auditory, speech or cognitive disabilities. Besides making a site more accessible for users with limitations, research proves that doing so improves SEO, increases download speeds and has better usability.<sup><a href="https://w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup> The <a class="link" href="https://w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/" target="_blank">WC3</a> and <a class="link" href="https://a11yproject.com" target="_blank">A11Y Project</a> are two major advocates for web accessibility and provide <a class="link" href="https://w3.org/TR/WCAG21">guidelines</a> and patterns for developers to help make their applications accessible. </p>
            <p>Here is a short list of <a class="link" href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94" target="_blank">Accesibility Criteria</a> that every application should include:</p>
           <ol>
             <li>Add Contrasting Color</li>
             <li>Design usable :Focus States</li>
             <li>Use Lables with Form Fields &amp; Inputs</li>
             <li>Write Alternative Text for Images</li>
             <li>Use Proper Markup for Content</li>
             <li>Support Keyboard Navigation</li>
           </ol>
           <p>The Color-Contrast Ration between text and its background should be at least 3/4.5 to 1 depending on the font boldness. The WebAIM group offers a <a class="link" href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Color Contrast Checker</a> that allows developers to calculate the score for <a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head">conformance levels</a> in real time. When using color as an indicator, be sure to pair it with an icon, a label or pattern. Charts and graphs are often difficult to read so using shapes and varying sizes can help enhance monochromatic vision. You can use the <a class="link" href="https://colororacle.org">Color Oracle</a> to simulate what vision impaired folk see in real-time.</p>
           <p>Adding a visual cue such as an underline text style will help an element stand out. Focus Indicators help people know which element has the keyboard focus and helps with navigating a website. Elements that should be focusable are links, form fields, widgets, buttons and menu items. Be sure to create a state that is highly visible, with good contrast to stand out from the rest.</p>
           <p>People who use screen readers navigate form using the tab key and the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element is equipped to handle this action. Never use placeholder text for accessibility because it will be passed over during tabbing. There are plenty of resources for creating <a class="link" href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank">Accessible Forms</a>.</p>
           <p>Vision impaired users rely on screen readers to 'hear' what is being displayed and the <code>&lt;alt=""&gt;</code> attribute is used to convert text to speech. Simply describe the image or what is happening in the background.</p>
           <p>Web browsers read the content and the type of HTML element that contains it. Browsers create their own structure of how the page renders using the elements. Using inline-styles will negatively affect accessibility.</p>
           <p>Navigation is accessible only when the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element is properly markedup; this makes it easy to navigate a page through interactive elements that include links, buttons and input fields. Add a <code>:focus</code> state to add a visual indicator. Navigation should be intuitive, minimal and flow from left to right, top to bottom. Test your website using the tab key.</p>
