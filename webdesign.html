          <p><img src="img/ide.jpg" class="imgR">An <em><b>Integrated Development Environment</b></em> is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing versitle components in a single program by which all development is done. In general, an IDE is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based workbench designed to aid a developer in building software applications with an integrated source-code editor combined with all the required (automation) tools at hand. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software, which helps developers quickly execute actions without switching to other applications.<sup><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26860/integrated-development-environment-ide" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> My IDE of choice is Brackets. It's really easy to use so I recommend checking it out.<sup><a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>

          <p><img src="img/xampp.jpg" class="imgL">A <em><b>Local Host-Server</b></em> is a computer networking configuration that creates an online-like environment for developers to test applications without internet access. Specifically, localhost is the host name for your computer and uses the IP address 127.0.0.1 to act as a loopback mechanism used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical network interface.<sup><a href="http://www.tech-faq.com/127-0-0-1.html" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> Configuring a local host manually is beyond the scope of this project so I strongly suggest that you head over to Apache Friends and download their open source cross-platform web server-stack.<sup><a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup> <small><em>Note: Before downloading this program, research alternatives that are best suited for you. For example, I work within a Microsoft Windows Operating System and there is a WAMP server-stack designed specifically for Microsoft Windows OS. However, my preferred server-stack is XAMPP due to its versitility.</em></small></p>

          <p>A <em><b>Version Control System</b></em> is a software configuration that records changes to web files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For all intents and purposes, a VCS is an online storage facility for your code, enabling dDevelopers with the ability to manage source-code, track all file versions (independent of network access) and coordinate a non-linear workflow in a team environment.<sup><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup> Github is my VCS of choice.

          <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
          <p><em><b>HTML</b></em> is a markup language that defines the structure of the content on a webpage. Sections of markup are defined with <em>Elements</em>, which are used to carve out sections of the structure, HTML <em>Tags</em> are used to define those elements and Internet browsers read and displays the HTML content to the user. Tags have an opening and closing component, with a few exceptions. Moreover, we can add <em>Attributes</em> to a tag to specify how the content will display (explained later with CSS).<sup><a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/what-is-html/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup> Although this section provides only basic principles required of an HTML template, you can vist them good folks over at <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Mozilla</a> to learn everything there is to know about web design and development.

        <!-- -->
        <div id="template" class="intro">
          <h4>Required Elements for an HTML Template</h4>
          <p>The required structural elements for an HTML template are as follow:</p>
          <img src="img/requiredHTML.jpg"> 
          <p>The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the first line of a page. I do not know why.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element (aka 'root') is on the second and final line of a page. This element is a wrapper for <em>everything</em> on the entire page: that which can be seen or not!</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is the area consisting of that which you cannot see and is used to store pertinent data on a page. Within this area you can use <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to make the page mobile-compatible, document the webpage in the browser and specify resources being used, respectively.</p>
          <p>The final required element is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and is the area containing all content that you want displayed to users.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- -->
        <div id="defineSec" class="intro">
          <h4>Defining Sections and Headings</h4>
          <p>Inside of the body is where all the magic happens. It is here that you can outline information that you want displayed based on the type of information being offered. The most important HTML elements that you can use to section information are the <em>Header, Nav, Main, Section, Article, Aside and Footer</em>.<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup></p>
          <img src="img/section.jpg"> 
          <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag, when used, is the first section users encounter and <em>contains vital information related to the website</em> such as a logo, author or navigational aids. The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag can be used within the header or independently to help users navigate a webpage. A nav tag can <em>provide links within the current document or to other documents</em> with common examples including menus, tables of contents and indexes.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of the page, before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, you can use the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag to <em>highlight the page author, copyright data or social media links</em>.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags can be a bit confusing because although they are semantically different (the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> is actually a text content element), act nearly the same when used in the same situation. What is important here is to use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag as <em>the main container for a section</em> and use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag for the most important content of the body.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is used to <em>contain content intended to be independently distributabble</em> such as a magazine article or blog post.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag is used for <em>content that is indrectly related to the documents main content</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- -->
        <div id="defineContent" class="intro">
          <h4>Defining Content</h4>
          <p>Content elements are used to organize sections of content and are nested within any section element. There are dozens of elements that can be used to markup your content, but choosing the right element depends wholly on that which you are marking up. Aside from adding identifying sections of content with headings and adding text, you may want to include an list, a form, some sort of multimedia, a script, interactivity or a web component. There are dozens of elements at your disposal, but the only way you will understand them is to study them.<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Element" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.html-5-tutorial.com/all-html-tags.htm" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup></p>
          <img src="img/content.jpg"> 
          <p>In the example above, there are four kinds of tags used, all of which no project goes without.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tags illustrate a <em>Heading</em> that is used to define the title of any section. There are six heading levels <code>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</code> which decrease in size from 1 to 6.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag represents a <em>paragraph of text</em>. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is an inline-text semantic <em>creates a hyperlink to another webpage, file, or location within the same page</em>. This is an inline text semantic which helps define the meaning or purpose of a word, line or text.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags are used in unison to <em>create an unordered list of items</em>, which will display as bullet points. You could also use the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag to create an <em>ordered list</em>, which will display an ascending counter.</p>
          <p>By the way, the <code>src="..."</code> that you see in the <code>&lt;im /&gt;</code> is called an <a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp">Attribute</a>, which is useful for manipulating the state of a particular element or referencing a source as illustrated. Although outside of the scope of our focus, keep in mind that attributes are used when making a website accessible and we will cover this below.</p>
          <p>These days more and more developers are using <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net" target="_blank"><b><u>Static Site Generators</u></b></a> to expedite the markup process.</p>

        <div id="accessibility" class="intro">
          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
          <p>In web design, <em><b>Accessibility</b></em> refers to the practice of designing digital content and applications that can be used by people with visual, motor, auditory, speech or cognitive disabilities. Besides making a site more accessible for users with limitations, research proves that doing so improves SEO, increases download speeds and has better usability.<sup><a href="https://w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup> The <a href="https://w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/" target="_blank"><b><u>WC3</u></b></a> and <a href="https://a11yproject.com" target="_blank"><b><u>A11Y Project</u></b></a> are two major advocates for web accessibility and provide <a href="https://w3.org/TR/WCAG21"><b><u>guidelines</u></b></a>, patterns and checklist for developers to make their applications accessible. </p>
          <p>Here is a short list of<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94" target="_blank"><b> <u>Accesibility Criteria</u></b></a> that every application should include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add Contrasting Color</li>
            <li>Design usable :Focus States</li>
            <li>Use Lables with Form Fields &amp; Inputs</li>
            <li>Write Alternative Text for Images</li>
            <li>Use Proper Markup for Content</li>
            <li>Support Keyboard Navigation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The Color-Contrast Ration between text and its background should be at least 3/4.5 to 1 depending on the font boldness. The WebAIM group offers a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank"><b><u>Color Contrast Checker</u></b></a> that allows developers to calculate the score for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head"><b><u>conformance levels</u></b></a> in real time. When using color as an indicator, be sure to pair it with an icon, a label or pattern. Charts and graphs are often difficult to read so using shapes and varying sizes can help enhance monochromatic vision. You can use the <a href="https://colororacle.org"><b><u>Color Oracle</u></b></a> to simulate what vision impaired folk see in real-time.</p>
          <p>Adding a visual cue such as an underline text style will help an element stand out. <em>Focus Indicators</em> help people know which element has the keyboard focus and helps with navigating a website. Elements that should be focusable are <em>links, form fields, widgets, buttons and menu items.</em> Be sure to create a state that is highly visible, with good contrast to stand out from the rest.</p>
          <p>People who use screen readers navigate form using the tab key and the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element is equipped to handle this action. Never use placeholder text for accessibility because it will be passed over during tabbing. There are plenty of resources for creating <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank"><b><u>Accessible Forms</u></b></a>.</p>
          <p>Vision impaired users rely on screen readers to 'hear' what is being displayed and the <code>&lt;alt=""&gt;</code> attribute is used to convert text to speech. Simply describe the image or what is happening in the background.</p>
          <p>Web browsers read the content and the type of HTML element that contains it. Browsers create their own structure of how the page renders using the elements. Using inline-styles will negatively affect accessibility.</p>
          <p>Navigation is accessible only when the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element is properly markedup; this makes it easy to navigate a page through interactive elements that include links, buttons and input fields. Add a <code>:focus</code> state to add a visual indicator. Navigation should be intuitive, minimal and flow from <em>left to right, top to bottom</em>. Test your website using the tab key.</p>
          <p>When you think your code is up to par and accessible, download <em>the Accessibility Engines</em> web browser extension to <a href="https://axe-core.org/" target="_blank"><b><u>Check a Websites Accessibility</u></b></a>.</p>
