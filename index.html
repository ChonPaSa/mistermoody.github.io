        <h3 class="line-1 anim-typewriter">Hello. My name is Ray.</h3>
        <p>I'm a certified TEFL instructor and self-taught web developer focused on building learner-centric web apps.</p> 
        <img src="img/jpnyahata.jpg" class="" alt="Mister Moody sitting by the lake." style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
        <p>For nearly 20 years, I have worked with public and private institutions of education in America, China, Japan and South Korea. My contributions as a non-traditional educator consist of providing TEFL recruitment and teacher training services, developing curricula, analyzing learner assessments, and facilitating courses for learners of varying age and fluency levels. In the few years that I have practiced web development, I have become a proficient project manager capable of designing, developing and deploying an application to specification. </p>

        <p><img src="img/workVanilla.jpg" class="imgL" alt="Mister Moody"/>As a life-learner, I have always held a tremendous amount of respect for academics and the learning process as a whole. Learning was a value instilled in me by my mother who thought I was a cheeky youth, and instead of taking privileges away from me whenever I misbehaved, she would confine me to my bedroom and force me to read a book then summarize what I read. Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
        <p><img src="img/jpnID.jpg" class="imgR" alt="Mister Moody"/>Being a disciplined learner from a young age, I have an incessant thirst for knowledge, which undoubtedly led to my attendance at six universities in three countries. Of the multiple disciplines that I have studied, foreign language has invariably had the most profound impact on my life as it has allowed me to pursue career opportunities that I would otherwise not be privy to while affording me a unique perspective of the foreign cultures that I lived within.</p>
